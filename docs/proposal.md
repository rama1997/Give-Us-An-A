##Project Summary
  We want to make an agent that will kill an enemy as swiftly as possible and by taking the least amount of health. There will be built obstacles in between the enemy and the agent. These enemies will have a high enough health such that the agent will need to learn how to enchant their weapons, use potions, or use obstacles in order to avoid death. Our learning algorithm will take in the enemy type, positions and dimensions of obstacles, and time. Then, the algorithm will output the agentâ€™s path, velocity, enchanted weapons, potions, timing of weapon attacks, and when to switch weapons.
