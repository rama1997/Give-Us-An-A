## Summary
We want to make an agent that will eliminate enemies as swiftly as possible while taking the least amount of damage. To facilitate this there will be obstacles between the enemy and agent. Enemies will have a high enough health such that the agent will need to learn how to enchant their weapons, use potions, or use obstacles in order avoid death. Our learning algorithm will take in the enemy type, positions and dimensions of obstacles, and time. Then, the algorithm will output the agentâ€™s path, velocity, enchanted weapons, potions, timing of weapon attacks, and when to switch weapons.
